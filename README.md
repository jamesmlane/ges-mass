# Lane, Bovy, & Mackereth (202X)

This repository contains code to replicate the results of our [paper]().

## Requirements

The normal `scipy`/`numpy` stack as well as `matplotlib` and `astropy`. We recommend the development version of [galpy](https://github.com/jobovy/galpy), as that may contain recent updates to the spherical distribution function code. If you need to download APOGEE data we use [apogee](https://github.com/jobovy/apogee) and if you need to download Gaia data we use [gaia_tools](https://github.com/jobovy/gaia_tools).
